== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are Social Share Links? =

They are links, usually above and below your post content, which make it easy for readers to share your content using their Social accounts.



= What is special about these Share Links? =

The share links provided by each Social Service have some major downsides. To begin with none of them are consistently styled which makes them look messy together. More importantly, each includes adds its own external javascript file to your website. This slows down the loading of your website and includes a tracking feature to trace what users of your site are looking at.

We don't believe that you should have to suffer this to have Social Share links on your site.
