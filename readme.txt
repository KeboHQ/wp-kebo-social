== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are Social Share Links? =

They are links, usually above and below your post content, which make it easy for readers to share your content using their Social accounts.

This generates more visitors to your website from social services and social markers are increasingly important for SEO.

= What is special about these Share Links? =

The share links provided by each Social Service have some major downsides. To begin with none of them are consistently styled which makes them look messy together. More importantly, each includes adds its own external javascript file to your website. This slows down the loading of your website and includes a tracking feature to trace what users of your site are looking at.

We don't believe that you should have to suffer this to have Social Share links on your site.

= What other features are going to be added? =

The next major feature to be added are Social Feeds for Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn.

After that we will include the ability to send your new content to Social Networks.

We also have many other smaller features planned, like Social Share buttons for images/music/videos in post content and much more.

= Will this plugin end up bloated and slow down my site? =

We have built Kebo Social from the ground up with its size in mind. It uses a modular structure, so that if a feature is not turned on it does not run any code at all. This means that any features you are not using are not impacting your website.

On top of this all the features share resources where appropriate, so that it should end up being more efficient than having a different plugin for each feature.
